      <h2>Detail</h2>
      <p>
        Ghost Words is a learning app designed to support sentence memorization.<br>
        It splits text by spaces and gradually reveals each word from the first letter onward, helping you strengthen active recall without stress.
        Because the method is based on space-separated text, it works with any language — English, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, or any other text you choose.

        <div class="side">
          1. Add the sentences you want to memorize. (For Japanese, Chinese, or Korean, insert spaces where you want to separate words.)<br>
          2. Reveal each word step by step, starting from the first letter.<br>
          3. If you struggle, reveal more letters. If you remember, keep it hidden.<br>
          4. Repeat until the whole sentence can be recalled smoothly.

        <div class="title">Why It Works</div>
        <div class="side">
          Ghost Words focuses on active recall, one of the most effective memory techniques.<br>
          By showing only the first letter and letting you recall the rest, the app forces your brain to retrieve the missing words.<br>
          This repeated retrieval process strengthens memory far more effectively than simple reading.

        <div class="side">
          • For non-space-separated languages (like Japanese, Chinese, Korean), insert spaces manually to improve results.<br>
          • Break long texts into one sentence per page for easier repetition.<br>
          • Adjust fonts and colors to reduce eye strain during long study sessions.
